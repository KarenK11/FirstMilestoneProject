<h1><b>Karen's First Milestone Project - User Centric Frontend</b></h1>

<h3>Welcome to my very first website!</h3>

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

This site was created in order to get familiar with common development tools like Gitpod, Git & GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code. The project itself will display a breakdown of the different technologies used in each of the different sections of the program

<h2><b>Technology</b></h2>

This project was written in HTML & CSS using Gitpod and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
